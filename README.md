## 📘 Overview  

This project implements a **real-time AI-based packet-level network error prediction system** using:  
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Scikit-learn  
- Synthetic dataset generation  

The system predicts whether an incoming packet will be **ERRONEOUS** or **NORMAL**, based on 12 engineered network features including packet size, latency, queue depth, congestion score, protocol type, and more.

The solution integrates:  
✔ Dataset generator  
✔ Neural network training pipeline  
✔ Real-time inference simulator  
✔ Result visualizations and metrics
